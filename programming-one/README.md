This module is the principle module about programming. When you finish this module, you will be able to understand and create algorithms.

The Study plan for this module is watch the videos and practice by solving the algorithms of our list.
As we know that one of the most important role of a developer is coding, this module is one of our main focus.
We will practice solving algorithms together in our two week meetings.
